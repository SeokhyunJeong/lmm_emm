# lmm-emm
The official repository of  
"Large multimodal model-based environment-aware mobility management", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,  
"Large multimodal model-aided geometry-aware mobility management for 6G ultra-dense networks", In Proc. IEEE Global Communication Conference 2025.

We have uploaded the channel capacity map (CCM) estimation stage.  
Please run **inference.py**.  
Requirements.txt will be uploaded soon.  

You can download the fine-tuned models from the Google Drive link provided below
